  history: A mysterious box full of trinkets appears on a corner, your mama duck
    taught you to never touch strange things, after all they could be dangerous traps
    laid out by vicious hunters! But you never learned to listen to your mom, so
    you touch the box with your feathers making a green turtle shell appear and start
    spinning around the room
