  history: This may sound like a lie, but you have a cousin that trained to be a
    ninja and when you two were little ducklings, he said that he blessed you with
    the ninja quack which would give you powers! Of course you thought it as a joke,
    but when you started turning invisible after killing an enemy, you started to
    think that maybe your cousin was telling the truth
