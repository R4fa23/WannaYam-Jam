  nameCard: Iron feathers
  effect: Increases your damage by 20%
  history: "Suddenly your feathers feel so heavy! It\u2019s like you\u2019re carrying
    the weight of the world in you little body! Of course none of this is happening,
    they are just fusing to your weapon and oh boy, that's making you feel so powerful,
    not even the idiot geese back home can stop you now!"
